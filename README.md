## 🌱 A Little Note
This website may not be perfect — and that’s okay.
I’m still learning how to build, design, and integrate AI tools into real-world projects. You might find parts that feel incomplete, messy, or not as smooth as they should be — but every bit of it was made with effort, curiosity, and the intention to grow.
I’ll keep learning, keep improving, and make it better day by day. Thank you for visiting Petrichor Whispers 🌧️✨
